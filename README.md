# Costa Rican Household Poverty Level Prediction

This project is related to the past Kaggle competition [Costa Rican Household Povertly Level Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/costa-rican-household-poverty-prediction). The goal is to build a classification model that predicts the poverty level of households in Costa Rica to identify households that are in risk of extreme poverty.

Note: This project is not completed yet, I'm still working on it.
